        <p>I specialize in building modern web applications with a passion for clean, seamless user interfaces and a minimalistic style. I focus on creating beautiful and functional designs, and I&apos;ve expanded my stack with technologies like <strong>Supabase</strong> to build complete applications, allowing me to bring full product ideas to life.</p>
        <p>I believe in going beyond the basics, focusing on performance and the small details that elevate a project from good to exceptional.</p>
        <p>My favorite framework right now is <strong>Next.js</strong>, but I am also exploring new technologies like <strong>Astro</strong>.</p>
        <p>I am a dedicated developer driven by continuous learning and a commitment to excellence. Currently based in Venezuela, I am available for work and open to new opportunities.</p>
