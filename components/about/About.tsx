        <p>As mentioned before, I develop frontend websites using React and Next.js with meticulous attention to detail. Passionate about frontend technologies and seamless user interfaces with a minimalistic style. I am always trying to create beautiful and functional designs, and while I understand some backend development concepts, my true passion lies in frontend development.</p>
        <p>I believe in taking projects a step further to deliver amazing user experiences that are both high-level and challenging for me.</p>
        <p>My favorite framework right now is Next.js, but I am also exploring new technologies like Astro. I am a perseverant person, always working hard to achieve my goals. At this time I&apos;m currently based in Venezuela and available for work.</p>
